	<h4>And smaller - this is a h4 tag</h4>
	<h5>And smaller - this is a h5 tag</h5>
	<h6>And smaller - this is a h6 tag</h6>
	<p>As you can see in the headers, you can choose a size from the number, h1 biggest and h6 smallest.This is a paragraph, it uses the p tag which is a paragraph. Up above is a hr tag, which is a horizantal line. Then there is a br tag, that is a new line.</p>
	<p>This is a new paragaph, some tags automaticly have a 2 new line, like p tags and div tags</p>
	<div>
		<p>This p tag is in a div tag. This tag indicated a group. This does not do anything yet, but soon it will be very useful.</p>
	</div>
	<span>This is a span tag, it is useful for grouping specific text, but it only makes no new line, this can be useful. Another than the new line diffence span tags and div tags are the same</span>
	<span>This is another span tag, as you can see there is only is no line!</span>
